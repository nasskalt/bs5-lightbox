# Lightbox for Bootstrap 5 ðŸŒ 

A pure JavaScript Bootstrap 5 lightbox that supports images, video, galleries, YouTube, Vimeo, and Instagramâ€”built
around Bootstrap's Modal and Carousel plugins.

See the official documentation: https://trvswgnr.github.io/bs5-lightbox/

Many parts do not work now. Updated Docs down below at [How to use it](#How-to-use-it).

Please use my [Issues Tab](https://github.com/nasskalt/bs5-lightbox/issues). I will take responsibility if
there are any issues since I rewrote and changed many bits.

Feel free to email me at [benjamin@nasskalt.com](mailto:benjamin@nasskalt.com).

<script src="dist/index.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

See the [release tab](https://github.com/nasskalt/bs5-lightbox/releases)
for [download](https://github.com/nasskalt/bs5-lightbox/releases/download/V1.0/index.bundle.min.js)

Lightbox for Bootstrap 5 will automatically initialize on import.

Currently, I do __not__ offer a CDN for this project. Can be discussed for the future.

## How to use it

### Importing

By default, it will target elements with the `data-toggle="lightbox"` attribute.
If you want to target a different element, import the `Lightbox` class and instantiate it:

```js
for (const el of document.querySelectorAll('.my-lightbox-toggle')) {
    el.addEventListener('click', Lightbox.initialize)
}
```

### New Bits

#### Sizing

You can now size it to yourself with this css class.

Without it defaults to the default bootstrap modal size.

```css
.modal-override-size {
    max-width: 90vw;
}
```
